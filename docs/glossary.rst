  Field index
    A type of index that is optimized to index single simple tokenized

    these values exacty.

  Text index
    A type of index which indexes a value in such a way that parts of
    it can be searched in a non-exact manner.  When a text index is

    "stopwords" the text might have.

  repoze.catalog
    `Another package
    <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/repoze.catalog>`_ that hypatia was forked from.

  Virtualenv
    An isolated Python environment.  Allows you to control which
    packages are used on a particular project by cloning your main
    Python.  `virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_
