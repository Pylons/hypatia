0.1a3 (2013-01-10)
------------------

- Optimize ``index_doc`` implementations of field and keyword index in cases
  where the discriminator returns the default.

- Remove code from ``hypatia.path``.  This package no longer supports
  PathIndex.

- Remove ``interfaces.IIndexQuery`` interface.  It was never relevant, as
  indices cannot be expected to implement all of its methods, only the ones
  which apply to each index.

- ``BaseIndexMixin`` no longer supplies default implementation of applyFoo
  methods which raise NotImplementedError.  Each index is now responsible for
  implementing all of its own applyFoo methods.  This is in the interest of
  fidelity with new query methods such as ``eq``, which are similarly not
  implemented in the base.

- Indexes are now compelled to implement a ``qname`` method for use by
  queries.

- ``DoesNotContain`` query renamed to ``NotContains`` for symmetry with other
  negated query names.

- New index methods: ``eq``, ``noteq``, ``ge``, ``le``, ``lt``, ``gt``,
  ``any``, ``notany``, ``all``, ``notall``, ``inrange``, ``notinrange``,
  ``contains``, ``notcontains``.  These methods return query objects.  Ex::

      catalog['flavors'].eq('peach')

- Query objects refactored internally to deal in index objects rather than
  index names.

- The ``query.parse_query`` function now requires a ``catalog`` argument.

- Query objects now supply an .execute method which returns a ResultSet.

- ResultSet objects are returned from .execute.  They represent a set of
  docids; they are iterable and have various methods for obtaining single
  objects (like ``one``, ``first``) and sorting (``sort``).

- All Query objects now have a ``flush`` method which accepts arbitrary
  positional and keyword arguments.  Calling the ``flush`` method of a query
  object will cause the ``flush`` method of all indexes participating in the
  query with the value passed to Query.flush with the same positional and
  keyword arguments.  This is to support Substance D upstream, which may
  require indexes to be flushed before a query happens.

- Add a ``document_repr`` method to all indexes which accepts a docid and
  returns a string represnting the index's knowledge about that docid.

0.1a2 (2012-07-02)
------------------

- This version of the code is incompatible with indexes produced by 0.1a1.
  There is no upgrade script.  Shame on you for using software with a 0.1a1
  version number and expecting backwards compatibility.

- Add `hypatia.catalog.CatalogQuery.sort` API for sorting external sets
  of docids based on index values.

- Add ``IIndexEnumeration`` interface, which all indexes must support.
  This implied the following backwards incompatibilities:

  - New interface methods: docids, docids_count, indexed, indexed_count,
    not_indexed and not_indexed_count.

  - documentCount method renamed to indexed_count.

  - wordCount method renamed to word_count.

- Remove unused INBest interface.

- IIndexInjection interface ``clear`` method renamed to ``reset`` to prevent
  confusion with dictionary ``clear`` (catalog is often dictionarylike).
  Catalog ``clear_indexes`` method replaced with ``reset``.

0.1a1
-----

- Initial release: fork of repoze.catalog and zope.index, combined.
