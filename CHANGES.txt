0.4 (10/6/2008)

  Features

    Speed up keyword index 'or' (union) queries by using a single
    IFBTree.multiunion instead of multiple calls to IFBTree.union;
    this is most helpful for speeding up 'or' queries where there are
    lots of terms in the query sequence.

  Documentation

    Add ``overview`` page.

  Features

    Add ``repoze.catalog.document.DocumentMap`` class, which provides

  Documentation

    Add API documentation for catalog and document map.
