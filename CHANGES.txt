0.1a2 (2012-07-02)
------------------

- This version of the code is incompatible with indexes produced by 0.1a1.
  There is no upgrade script.  Shame on you for using software with a 0.1a1
  version number and expecting backwards compatibility.

- Add `hypatia.catalog.CatalogQuery.sort` API for sorting external sets
  of docids based on index values.

- Add ``IIndexEnumeration`` interface, which all indexes must support.
  This implied the following backwards incompatibilities:

  - New interface methods: docids, docids_count, indexed, indexed_count,
    not_indexed and not_indexed_count.

  - documentCount method renamed to indexed_count.

  - wordCount method renamed to word_count.

- Remove unused INBest interface.

- IIndexInjection interface ``clear`` method renamed to ``reset`` to prevent
  confusion with dictionary ``clear`` (catalog is often dictionarylike).
  Catalog ``clear_indexes`` method replaced with ``reset``.

0.1a1

- Initial release: fork of repoze.catalog and zope.index, combined.
