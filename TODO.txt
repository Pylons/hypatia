- Extend the querytype methods offered by KeywordIndex (add Gt, Lt, etc).

- Add data structures to return docids_count(), indexed_count() and
  not_indexed_count() more efficiently if these methods get used frequently.

- Do less (ideally no) work during a reindex in the text index when nothing has
  changed.
